    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Aloo Phujia is a delicious North-Indian recipe which is prepared with 
        potatoes, tomatoes, green peas and spices. This vegetarian dish is 
        easy to cook and has mild spicy flavours. If you love potatoes, this 
        simple traditional Indian recipe is sure to win your heart. Serve it 
        with freshly made chapatis and onion and tomato raita or with steamed 
        rice and salad and you are going to have the best ever experience of 
        homemade food. If you want to add some more taste to Aloo Phujia, you 
        can add a few drops of warm ghee to it before serving. It is different

        preparation.</p>
