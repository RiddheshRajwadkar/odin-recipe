    <div class="Subtitle"><h2>Description</h2></div>

    <div class="Paragraph"><p>Aloo Phujia is a delicious North-Indian recipe 
        which is prepared with potatoes, tomatoes, green peas and spices. This
        vegetarian dish is easy to cook and has mild spicy flavours. If you love 
        potatoes, this simple traditional Indian recipe is sure to win your heart. 
        Serve it with freshly made chapatis and onion and tomato raita or with 
        steamed rice and salad and you are going to have the best ever experience 
        of homemade food. If you want to add some more taste to Aloo Phujia, you 
        can add a few drops of warm ghee to it before serving. It is different 
        from the Aloo Bhujia, the popular dish of Bihar and UP, which is a dry 
        preparation.</p></div>
